{
    "Problem Understanding & Goal Setting": "This involves reading the problem statement, identifying the core objective, parsing the given information (variables, constraints, equations, diagrams), and often rephrasing the goal in the LLM's own terms or breaking it down into sub-goals.",
    "Knowledge Recall & Formula Application": "Accessing and stating relevant mathematical definitions, formulas, theorems, identities, or standard procedures needed to solve the problem.",
    "Strategy Formulation & Planning": "Devising a plan or choosing a specific mathematical strategy (e.g., algebraic manipulation, factorization, using geometry theorems, testing cases, using specific formulas) to tackle the problem or a sub-problem. Often involves considering alternative approaches.",
    "Calculation & Symbolic Manipulation": "Performing arithmetic operations, algebraic simplifications, solving equations, evaluating expressions, factorizing, expanding, computing derivatives or integrals, simplifying radicals, etc. This is the execution of the mathematical steps.",
    "Logical Deduction & Interpretation": "Drawing logical conclusions based on previous steps, definitions, or calculations. Interpreting the meaning of intermediate results (e.g., a zero dot product implies perpendicularity) or constraints (e.g., divisibility rules imply properties of digits).",
    "Vertification & Double Checking": "Explicitly reviewing calculations, checking results using alternative methods, testing with examples, ensuring constraints are met, re-reading the problem statement, or confirming the validity of intermediate steps or the final answer. This is a meta-cognitive step focused on accuracy.",
    "Critical Assessment & Refinement (including Error/Contradiction Handling)": "Evaluating the plausibility or correctness of intermediate results or interpretations. Identifying potential issues, contradictions, inconsistencies, edge cases, or surprising results. Questioning assumptions and potentially correcting the reasoning path based on these assessments.",
    "Systematic Exploration & Case Analysis": "Methodically examining different possibilities, cases, or examples. This often involves listing items (divisors, possible numbers, groupings) or checking conditions for different inputs or ranges.",
    "Conclusion & Answer Formulation": "Stating the final result derived from the preceding steps and often formatting it as requested by the problem (e.g., common fraction, simplest radical form, specific format like (r, Î¸))."
